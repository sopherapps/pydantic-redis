# asyncio_example

This is a working example using python-aioredis with FastAPI. 

# Requirements
## Fastapi and Uvicorn
This example requires Fastapi and Uvicorn to run. You can install them from the requirements.txt in this directory

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Redis Server
This example requires a running redis server. You can change the RedisConfig on line 28 in the example to match connecting to your running redis.

For your ease of use, we've provided a Makefile in this directory that can start and stop a redis using docker. 

```make start-redis```

```make stop-redis```

The example is configured to connect to this dockerized redis automatically
