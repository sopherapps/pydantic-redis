"""Exposes the `Store` for managing a collection of asynchronous Model's.

Stores represent a collection of different kinds of records saved in
a redis database. They only expose records whose `Model`'s have been
registered in them. Thus redis server can have multiple stores each
have a different image of the actual data in redis.

A model must be registered with a store before it can interact with
a redis database.
